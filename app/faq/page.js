                  We are your private sous chef! We prepare all your food to cut
                  down the time it takes for you to make a home cooked meal
                  every week! Similar to how restaurants work, in the morning a
                  sous chef comes in, slices all the vegetables, fires all the
                  soups, prepares everything for quick turn around for the
                  evening. That's what we're doing here, in your home, for you!
                  Everything left for you will be quick and simple. Here's a
                  quick rundown - You sign up, every Thursday you'll get an
                  email from us with your shopping list. Make sure you've got
                  all of that for before your Sous Chefs scheduled arrival. Sit
                  back, relax! We'll prep it all so you have quick, easy to cook
                  meals with minimal mess.

                  Yes! First, we send out the menus and shopping lists based on
                  your preferences discussed during intake so there shouldn't be
                  too much to substitute but you still can as long as you follow
                  some rules when substituting. Let's say the shopping list
                  calls for chicken for a chicken parm; another protein is
                  totally fine, even a friendly fungus (mushroom) can work
                  there! Is broccoli on the menu but everyone likes cauliflower?
                  That works! When you substitute, if you're not sure, feel free
                  to chat or do a quick google search of your substituted
                  recipe. Taking the chicken parm for example, when you google
                  search veal parm, tons of recipes come up and they're all
                  super similar to the chicken. Great sub! If we're going to try
                  raccoon parmesan, lets maybe pump the brakes there and check
                  with substitutions how that works. We need to make sure what
                  we sub still conforms to the meal. Smaller ingredients, such
                  as parsley, cilantro or some other minor things can sometimes
                  be wholly skipped without issue. At the end of the day, you're
                  eating, so we want to make what you love!

                  Great question! A recent favorite Steak Diane with asparagus
                  and mashed sweet potato. This one is definitely a feast but
                  super easy when we break it down for you. All this one takes
                  for you is a single cast iron pan and a baking sheet. We
                  prepped the meat and vaccuum sealed it, good for any night of
                  the week, cleaned, cut and sealed the asparagus and we
                  cleaned, peeled, seasoned and vaccuum sealed the mashed sweet
                  potato. On whatever night our clients choose to do Steak
                  Diane, this is now a 10 minute meal. Drop the potato in their
                  sous vide @ 185F 2 hours prior to dinner (this can be done via
                  app if you're at work!) 10 minutes before dinner, fire a cast
                  iron pan on the stove, set the oven to broil. Foil the sheet,
                  toss the asparagus on it, a splash of oil, into the oven!
                  Break out the steaks, sear them in the pan 2 minutes per side
                  and remove. Add the premade butter and shallot mixture we
                  prepped to the pan, 2 minutes later add the mushrooms. 3
                  minutes later add in congac and flambe! Now add in the
                  premixed sauce for 3 minutes, pull the potatoes and asparagus.
                  Steak back in the pan and all 3 on the table. A gourmet meal
                  in 10 minutes. 1 Pan. That's it. Not a fan of the red meat?
                  Sub in chicken, cook 5-6 minutes per side! Easy, same great
                  gourmet meal to your liking. We'll prep the chicken just the
                  same! This meal would normally require 2 hours to prepare. We
                  made it 10 minutes by having it all done for you!

                  A Sous Vide is also known as a precision cooker. It allows us
                  to cook a food at a very specific and exact temperature for a
                  set time. This isn't required but it allows us to do some cool
                  stuff. You can still make all our recipes with out it. But
                  here's a great example: Persousnal chef visited you on Monday
                  to prep everything. You're going to have Steak Diane on
                  Wednesday. When you leave for work Wednesday morning, just
                  drop the bag of potatoes in the water bucket, frozen or from
                  the fridge, it doesn't matter. You can use the app for your
                  sous vide machine to turn set it to the designated temperature
                  (185F) at whatever time you need to. In this case, if you
                  wanted to have dinner at 6PM, you'd set the app to turn the
                  sous vide on at 4. When it's time to eat, pull the bag out of
                  the water, mash the chunks in the bag with your hands while
                  drying it, cut a corner of the bag open and pipe potatoes onto
                  everyones plate!

                  Yes! We're going to be prepping 3 meals a day for 5 days for
                  you. In order to ensure freshness we vacuum seal most things.
                  Some things we store in our container system as they don't
                  spoil as quickly or they might need a day to reach peak
                  freshness. A Vaccuum sealer is required for our service. Our
                  container system is not but it is highly recommended. It will
                  make your life much, much easier. And they're all dishwasher
                  safe! If you don't own one, we can provide a vacuum sealer and
                  we can provide bags regularly. It's also lifechanging!
